What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?

Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had
to make for your customers?

Added more interfaces to separate things originally, for example we had to add
CellInterface and GridInterface and MovesInterface to separate the logic more beforehand.
Our customers asked this of us so we did end up doing it for them.
The code that was provided to was over all very specific and made me which we had maybe included more
detail in some of the java docs for interfaces so that someone reading our documentation would have a full understanding.



What was your experience like with your providers?
It was difficult getting code from them since we had a seperated dealing they suggested we change their code on our end
it was al over all, and we can definitely tell they were working to send the code as soon as they can.
