What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?

Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had
to make for your customers?

We had to create more interfaces for our customers, for example we had to add
CellInterface, GridInterface, and MovesInterface, this taught us that we should've had more seperate
classes before and not depend on concrete objects as it made it difficult for our partners to
implement our code. So lesson 1 - separate the logic more beforehand.
The code that was provided to was over all very specific and did not have many methods
we could go off of. We're grateful that we wrote detailed javadocs so that that someone reading our
documentation would have a full understanding, however we wish we did more for the interfaces.

What was your experience like with your providers?

Our experience with our providers was quite positive. While it was difficult getting code from them
since we had a seperated deadline they suggested we change their code on our end. We appriciate their
effort and we know it was hard with all the confusion during Thanksgiving.
