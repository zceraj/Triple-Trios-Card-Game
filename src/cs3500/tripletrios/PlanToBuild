if grid has 35 cells then there should be (35+1)/2 = 18 cards in each players hands

                              --To Do List:--

KEY:
"-" means to-do
"+" means completed
"*" means in progress

                                SOURCE CODE
Model:
- make the model read only
    - extend the interface to a read only three trios model intergace
        - The ability to create a game using the configuration files for the grid and the cards
        - The ability to create a copy of the grid
            - obserations:
              How big is the grid?
              What are the contents of a cell at a given coordinate?
              What are the contents of a player’s hand?
              Which player owns the card in a cell at a given coordinate?
              Is it legal for the current player to play at a given coordinate?
              Given a card and a coordinate, how many cards can a player flip by playing at a given coordinate?
              What is a player’s score in the game?
              Is the game over?
        - The current player plays a card from their hand at a given cell

View:
    - create a GUI view using java swing
    - interfaces for all the components of the view
        - frame
        - panel
        - gui rendering??

How we want the view to look
- a game board in the center (rows x cols big) -- light purple
- a column on each side of the grid defining the player's hand
- yellow or dark purple squares indicating the possible moves for the players
- onece a card is placed the yellow square turns into the card.

- a user should be able to click on a card in the hand,
and it should highlight that card somehow. In the image below,
the highlight is indicated as a thick grey border. You may choose another way of
highlighting if you wish so long as it is obvious it is selected.
- Additionally, your view should (temporarily) print a message (using System.out) containing the
index of the card that was clicked on as well as which player owns that hand.

  a user should be able to click on a cell in the grid and the view should (temporarily) print a
  message (using System.out) containing the coordinates of the cell that was clicked on, in whatever
  coordinate system you used in your model. Note: this is not the same thing as the physical mouse
  coordinates of the mouse event!

- a user can select
- a user can deselect a card by clicking the same card or another card

- clicking outside of the grid shouldn't do anything


Controller:
- make a plan for the controller

Main:
- fix the code with our actual model class names

                                  TESTING
- have the screenshots for the appropriate parts of the view:
    - At the start of the game
    - With a card selected from the Red Player’s hand
    - With a card selected from the Blue Player’s hand
    - At a non-trivial intermediate point of the game, meaning cards have been played and the hands of both players have decreased
