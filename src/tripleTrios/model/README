OVERVIEW:

GameModel:
- Interface that defines the methods needed to run the game such as:
  - starGame
  - placeCard
  - battles

GameModelImpl:
- Implements the GameModel interface and the logic of the game itself such as:
  - if the setup is valid
  - actual logic of starting the game and placing a card

QUICK START:

// 5x5 grid true for card cell, false for hole
boolean[][] cellTypes = {
    {true, false, true, false, true},
    {false, true, false, true, false},
    {true, false, true, false, true},
    {false, true, false, true, false},
    {true, false, true, false, true}
};
Grid grid = new Grid(cellTypes);
IPlayer player1 = new HumanPlayer("Player 1", Color.RED);
IPlayer player2 = new HumanPlayer("Player 2", Color.BLUE);
player1.addCard(new Card("King", 1, 2, 3, 4));
player2.addCard(new Card("Joker", 1, 2, 3, 4));

GameModelImpl gameModel = new GameModelImpl(grid, player1, player2);
gameModel.startGame();

gameModel.placeCard(player1.getHand.get(0), 0, 0);
