Things we haven't quite answered:

-- since you worked a lot on the player impl how did we make this such that we can use machines?
In a future assignment, we might ask you to implement a simple AI player for this game.
This will enable several possible scenarios, including solitaire play (person vs computer)
and fully-automated play (which may be useful for testing). You do not have to implement a computer
player right now, but you should design your model so that different player implementations could
exist for human or machines to play your game. You should attempt to design a player interface that
allows this to happen.

In a design document (in a separate text file), explain how you envision instantiating players
and your model, so that you could play a few moves of the game. This might be one part of your
README (see below), but probably should be a separate file.

We will give additional guidance in future assignments over how we suggest you implement players;
the goal in this assignment is for you to think through the design possibilities and explain what
you think might be an appropriate design.
